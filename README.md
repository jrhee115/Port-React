# Portfolio

##  Introduction

I created my portfolio using react. My portfolio has 4 tabs, home, portfolio, project, and about me. The portfolio is my photography page, project are for my coding projects, the the about is where you can contact me as well as a small bio. 

## How to use

<img src="src/images/pre-home.png">

1) Once you get on my website, please click any tab in the navbar container. It takes awhile for it to load however, once you click one of the tabs, everything loads but quicker. 

<img src="src/images/home.png">

2) After clicking the home tab you can scroll all the way down to see some photos that I took.

3) Going to the portfolio tab, I have more images that I took. The first container is a carousel effect and changes the images every 4 sec. 

<img src="src/images/project.png">

4) This is my project page, I add my top 3 projects on here. However if you click the image you will not be able to go to the github where there projects are placed. If you go to the about tab, and scroll to the bottom you will see a github icon and that will send you to my github page.

5) This tab is about me, I added a bio about myself. If you scroll towards the bottom of the page you will see 3 different icons, instagram, linkedin, and github. All 3 are clickable and will send you to my account.
